# Submit to the Velo Wishlist

As you work with Velo, as great a product as it is, there's a chance you might come across something you wish we'd add to the product that we haven't gotten to - yet.

To share your ideas with us head over to the [Wishlist page](https://www.wix.com/velo/wishlist) of the Velo site and let us know what you'd like to see added to our backlog.

There you'll not only be able to add your own items, you can also vote on other users' ideas. You can also see the status of existing items so you'll have an idea of when new features will be ready for you to use.

Our users' feedback is really important to us so please make use of this as often as you like and help us grow and improve to meet your needs.
